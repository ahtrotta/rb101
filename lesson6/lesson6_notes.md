# ** LESSON 6 **

=============================================================================

## **Introduction**

- this lesson contains more complicated programs than previous lessons
strategy:
1. break down the problem into smaller pieces, don't be afraid to start over
2. map out the flow of the program in a flowchart, using sub-processes to encapsulate well-defined components of the problem
3. when you're ready to tackle a component or sub-process, write out the pseudo-code for that sub-process only. it will most likely translate to a method (or methods), so devise clear inputs and outputs
4. don't copy and paste, write every line of code yourself
5. do the assignments in sequence
6. don't be afraid to watch the walk-through videos
