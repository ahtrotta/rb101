# ** LESSON 2 NOTES **

### **Ruby Style**

1. Set editor's tab function to 2 spaces, indenting should use spaces.
2. Use `#` at the beginnig of a line for comments.
3. For methods, variables, or files, use `snake_case` formatting.
4. Use constants for values that will not change in your Ruby program. Define them with all uppercase letters.
```ruby
# Constant declaration

FOUR = 'four'
FIVE = 5
```
5. Use `{}` instead of `do...end` if the expression fits on one line.
6. Use `CamelCase` formatting when declaring a class name.

### **Lecture: Kickoff**

- build fluency in syntax
- learn to think like a programmer
- learn to build applications
- debugging mindset

3 main buckets

1. learning to program procedurally
2. object-oriented programming
3. other stuff
  1. testing
  2. blocks
  3. tools
  4. problem solving

learning to code vs learning to program
1. learn grammar and syntax
2. build applications
- frustrating to jump between the two
- pseudo code
```
if total cards > 21
  then I busted
otherwise,
  1 hit or
  I stay
```

looking for help
- search using the 'right phrases'
  - use the stack trace
  - reading error messages
  - adding 'ruby'
- stack overflow
- ruby docs
 
asking for help
- treat launch school people like coworkers
- push everything to github
- forums
- chatrooms
- TA office hours

we're learning application development
- lots of different types of programming
- ruby is the syntax, good for all kinds of programming
