# ** LESSON 2 NOTES **

### **Ruby Style**

1. Set editor's tab function to 2 spaces, indenting should use spaces.
2. Use `#` at the beginnig of a line for comments.
3. For methods, variables, or files, use `snake_case` formatting.
4. Use constants for values that will not change in your Ruby program. Define them with all uppercase letters.
```ruby
# Constant declaration

FOUR = 'four'
FIVE = 5
```
5. Use `{}` instead of `do...end` if the expression fits on one line.
